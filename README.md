# Wasserstein-Modulation-Index
 Hi, I'm Takefumi Ohki.
 Thank you for your interests on the Wasserstein Modulation Index (Ohki, 2022, J Neurosci Methods, DOI: 10.1016/j.jneumeth.2022.109578).
 
 1.  Some codes (eegfilt.m and wMI_CallerRoutine) are uploaded (April 12th, 2022).
 2.  The function file(Wasserstein_MI) is uploaded (April 14th, 2022).
 3.  The demo code that demonstrates the constraint terms is under preparatation.
